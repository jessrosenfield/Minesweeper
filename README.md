========

An ambitious project for me, Akhil and Teja. We take a very opject-oriented approach in structuring the project, as the complete extent of our programming knowledge came from the AP Computer Science A curriculum. My partners are responsible for the GUI aspects of the object, while so far I have only focused on logistics so far.
